# Discovery



## Discovery Goals and Expectations

Discovery is about identifying the big unknowns.  This may be validating that you&#39;re solving the right problem, uncovering some required user research or finding key technological unknowns.  You don&#39;t have to solve everything, just get enough information or just get the proverbial ball rolling towards a solution.

Discovery Goals

- Prioritize risks and assumptions
- Find out what we don&#39;t know
  - Discover what could prevent us from going into product execution
- Begin to get answers to questions
  - Schedule follow-up sessions with SMEs, etc to get answers
- Develop mitigation plans for high priority risks and assumptions

Behaviors

- We need your full attention and energy to focus on the discussion
- Be engaged
- Remove distractions such as phones and laptops
- Take a break once per hour
- 1 hour lunch break


## Prepare for Discovery &amp; Framing

Discovery and Framing are typically run back-to-back.  Schedule a single room for the entire &quot;D&amp;F&quot; duration.  You&#39;ll want to keep all your post-its, whiteboard work, etc. in the same place day-to-day.  This helps to maintain continuity in your conversation.

**A note on Discovery** :  For a product and domain that&#39;s well understood, Discovery may be a few hours.  If it requires research, it may take several weeks.  Use the Scoping document to help determine the appropriate duration.  You may want to meet with your UX Designers to see if they have any research they need to complete as part of Discovery.
