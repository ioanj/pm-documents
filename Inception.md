# Inception

Inception brings the entire Product team together for the first time.  This is where you'll all develop a *common understanding* of what you'll be building, the desired outcomes.  At the end of the session, you'll walk out with a prioritized backlog - the next step is to get into the lab and start building!



## Goals

- Build a prioritized backlog
- Understand team expectations
- Understand compliance expectations
- Develop a collective understanding across the team of **what** you are building, for **who** and **why**
  - Have a collective understanding of the product&#39;s MVP

## Behaviors

- We need your full attention and energy to focus on the discussion
- Be engaged
- Remove distractions such as phones and laptops
- Take a break once per hour
- 1 hour lunch break

Inception is typically 1/2 a day to 1 full day.  This is where the entire team gathers to have a single, focused conversation on what you are building.
