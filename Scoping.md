## Scoping Goals

Scoping is a focused, time-boxed discussion with key members of the XP and product teams and the stakeholders.

The purpose of Scoping is to understand:

- **Why** we are building this product?
  - What benefits will CVS and the users realize from using the product (what problem are we trying to solve?)
- **What** will the product do? 
  - i.e. not _how_ it will do it  You're not solutioning, although some technical discussion is fine if it brings clarity to the conversation
- **Who** is going to use it?
  - Get enough information to provide a high-level estimate

### Scoping Expectations

The participants full attention and participation is required and will be directly reflected in the outcome of the session.  To that end, inform the participants that...

- We need your full attention and energy to focus on the discussion
- Be engaged
- Remove distractions such as phones and laptops
- This will enable us to obtain the information we need to provide a quality estimate.



## Prepare for Scoping

As the Product Manager:

- Meet with the Product Owner
  - Discuss the product
  - Get existing documentation
  - Obtain list of additional invitees
    - Application Architect
    - SME
    - SA
    - Stakeholders (a single stakeholder is best, someone _directly_ connected to the product and the related business)
- Schedule Room (90 minutes - 2 hours)
  - Large whiteboard recommended
  - Room for facilitator and note taker to move around freely
  - Projector/monitor (helpful, but optional)
- Send invitation
  - Include the scoping goals and agenda to the invitees
- Pair with another Product Manager
  - One person facilitates the meeting
  - The other writes on the board (no laptop note taker)
- Bring stickies, notes, pens for people to take notes and jot down questions

## Scoping Template

Use the template to help lead the conversation by writing it out on the white board prior to the start of the session.  As new infomation is discussed, capture it on the white baord.  This will be the official recording of the session.

_A guided conversation is best, with a facilitator and a scribe.  Generally work from left to right, but let the conversation flow._

**Business Goals** : What benefits will this product bring to CVS?

**Product Goals** : What benefits will this product bring to the Users (Actors)?

**Actors and Activities** : For each type of envisioned user, what are the major activities they&#39;ll undertake when they use this product?

**Risks** : What may impact our ability to deliver this product?  Note: This will include any dependencies on systems that are not associated with the XP lab.  Note that Risks are not called out explicitly in the agenda; they should naturally emerge during the discussion.  If not, call it out explicitly.

**Assumptions** : What assumptions are we making?  These may be related to the business model, marketability of the product, etc.  Note that Assumptions are not called out explicitly in the agenda.  You may have to call explore this explicitly.  This varies product-by-product.

**Non-Goals** : Anything that is out of scope or in the parking lot.  This can also be features that are not part of the MVP, but more of the product vision.  

**Technology and Interactions** : Are there any specific technology goals?  Any known interactions with other systems?

**People** :  List team members (Product Manager, Developers, Product Designers)

**Timelines** : Are there any desired dates to start this work?  Any desired date to deliver an MVP?
