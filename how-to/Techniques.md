# Techniques



## Affinity Mapping

Affinity Mapping is a great way to gather a breadth of ideas from participants and collectively organize them into themes.

**Brief How-to** :

- Discuss the topic or issue with the group (Ex. &quot;what are the risks with this product?&quot;)
- Hand out Post-Its to each group member (try to give everyone a different color)
- Set a time limit (5 minutes works well)
- Instruct everyone to write down their thoughts on the topic or issue.
  - One thought per Post-It
  - Remind everyone that there are no wrong answers
- Call time (you can do this before your time limit if it looks like everyone&#39;s done)
- There are many ways to do the theming... here&#39;s 2 of them:
  - Have the group put all the Post Its in a pile
    - Take each one and have the author speak to it _briefly_
    - Place the Post-It on the white board, wall, etc
    - Repeat steps i and ii for each Post it, with the team discussing and agreeing on how similar seeming ideas should be grouped
  - Have the group gather at the white board, wall, etc with their Post Its
    - Each person places their Post Its on the white board (generally everyone starts at once)
    - Everyone is free to move Post Its around and group them as they see fit
      - Thinking out loud helps here so others understand the reasoning
    - Keep going until everyone feels they&#39;re done 
- Draw a circle around each group or place a blank Post It above them
- Review each grouping of Post Its and discuss their common theme
- Write the theme down on the blank Post It or inside the circle

It&#39;s completely OK to have several versions of your themes if there are differing viewpoints.

Affinity Mapping is particularly useful during Discovery for discussions around risks and assumptions.

## Story Mapping

A Story Map is a visual narrative about your product...

It has a beginning and an end

You&#39;ll introduce characters/actors (your users)

They may interact

They&#39;ll undertake interesting activities as they work towards their goals
There will be a conclusion – it may not be what the characters expect... but it must be _satisfying_

Built collaboratively and with a top-down approach, a Story Map gives you:

- The &quot;Big Picture&quot;
- A visual representation of your backlog
- A framework for
  - Finding gaps
  - Design exercises to create
    - User Flows
    - Wireframes
  - Detailed discussions
  - Prioritization
  - Defining MVP
- **A collective understanding**

**Attendees** \*

- Facilitator
- Business Owner
- Product Manager (XP) or Product Owner (Scrum) – can also facilitate
- Developers
- UX Designers
- Architects

\*Remember the &quot;Two Pizza&quot; rule

## A Note On Post Its

Use the different sizes, shapes and colors of your post-its to help differentiate information.

## The 2 Pizza Rule

**Selecting the Right Participants - Let Pizza Be Your Guide**

A goal of each and every conversation is to come away with a **shared understanding**.  To achieve that shared understanding, we start with the &quot;2 pizza rule&quot; to limit the number of participants:

_If you were to order 2 pizzas to feed everyone you&#39;ve invited, would anyone go hungry?_

If so, you have too many participants!  I&#39;ve also heard this described as &quot;just enough people for a good dinner conversation&quot;.  Imagine your guests seated around your dinner table… too many people and the single conversation you hoped to have quickly disintegrates into multiple sidebars or people just disengaging; there are simply too many people to sustain a single, focused, productive conversation.  What it typically breaks down to is this:

_6 - 8 people is the maximum number of participants_

Keep your participant list small and focused on the necessary talents (those who can speak with authority - technical, financial, managerial, etc. - whatever your conversation requires).   **You&#39;re looking for quality, not quantity**.

**Behaviors**

After you&#39;ve invited the right people, it&#39;s critical that you explain the expected behaviors (especially since they fly in the face of what many experience each and every meeting-packed day). The importance of expected behaviors cannot be overemphasized.  A good conversation requires participation and focused engagement.  The expected behaviors are simple:

- Everyone is 100% attentive
  - No laptops
  - Phones on mute
- Everyone participates
- Single conversation

_The amount of energy and focus you put into the conversation will be directly reflected in the quality of the outcome_

In order to achieve the shared understanding mentioned earlier, everyone must practice the necessary behaviors.
