# Balanced Teams

A balanced team is an autonomous group of people with a variety of skills and perspectives that support each other towards a shared goal. It has all the resources and authority it needs to complete projects on its own. It values cross-disciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery. On a balanced team, team members take joint responsibility for the work.  They share in both successes and failures.  They trust that each team member will keep the success of the product and team in mind, not the success of the individual.

A tenet of the Balanced Team is that those closest to the product and its intended users are autonomous and empowered to make all product, design, and technical decisions*. While outside or higher-level stakeholders can (and should) have input, they need to trust that the product team has the best information to make the best decisions.

If things aren’t going well, the team will raise issues quickly and will iterate on their process to fix any issues. This type of trust creates a blameless culture: if something goes wrong, it’s not important to figure out who’s fault it was. Rather, it’s important for the team to fix the problem, understand how we can prevent this problem in the future, and get back on track.

* We acknowledge that, as good corporate citizens, there are standards, etc that we must comply with.
