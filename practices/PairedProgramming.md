# Paired Programming

## What

Pairing is when two individuals work side by side on the same task or problem.  Developers are paired together full time. Product Designers and Product Manager disciplines may also pair, either full time or part time as needed.

## Why

- To share context and prevent knowledge silos
- Build empathy and understanding for other teammates and practices
- Faster onboarding and up skilling
- Promotes personal and professional growth
- Constant code review (i.e. better quality code)
- Unblock problems faster
- Increased collaboration, creative thinking, and idea generation
- *Build better products*

## How

- 2 monitors, two keyboards, two mice, one codebase/backlog/computer
- Within a pair, there is a designated "driver" and "navigator" who switch roles frequently
- Pairs think aloud, vocalizing their thought process
- Rotate pairs frequently (most often daily)
