# Test Driven Development

## What

In Test Driven Development (TDD), Developers write tests that specify the desired behavior before writing code. 

## How

- Write unit tests before writing the implementation code
- Make sure the tests fail initially, then write code to pass the tests

## Why

- Ensures code quality by providing fast feedback when something breaks
- Code refactoring can be done more safely
- Reduces the need for manual testing
- Tests capture the Acceptance Criteria so it is easier to tell if all the criteria are covered
- Writing tests first means they are not biased by the implementation
- Tests are isolated from implementation
- It prevents over-engineering and helps to build only what is needed
- Designing tests first helps to design better code
- Writing a test first helps create a focus on the task at hand (just enough to complete the story)
