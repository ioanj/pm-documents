# Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM)

## What

The Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM) is a weekly session for the product team to review and prepare user stories to be worked on during the next iteration. When a story has been discussed by the team and successfully pointed, it's considered ready to be worked on.

## How

- Product Manager ensures that _prior to the IPM_, at least 2 iterations worth of user stories are written (with description and acceptance criteria) and properly prioritized in the backlog
- In priority order:
  - PM discusses a story (who, what and why) and the acceptance criteria
  - If applicable, the Product Designer reviews the wires and discusses interface behavior
  - Team members ask questions and the team comes to a common understanding of what's to be built
  - The team points the story

## Why

- Supports a prioritized backlog of stories that are understood and are ready to be worked on
- Provides the team with an opportunity to understand the next body of work
- Identifies missing stories, stories that are not yet ready to be worked on and stories that should be reprioritized
