# Product Demo

## What

The Product Demo is a regularly scheduled opportunity for the team to demonstrate the working software they've produced since the last demo. It also serves as an opportunity to review the KPIs and the latest research conducted by the team.  All of this should support a conversation on the alignment on the as a result of research results and changing business needs. 


## How

Attendees:
- Entire product team
- Sponsor (person who owns the budget)
- Additional Stakeholders (both business and IT)

Agenda:
- Team shares the work completed since the last demo
- PM shares KPI readout and any changes to product strategy or the backlog
- Team shares what theyâ€™re working on learning (experiments/user interviews)
- Sponsor suggests changes to the backlog as informed by the KPIs or changes to business strategy (*Note* : this should trigger a conversation on priority)

Default Frequency: Once every two weeks

Product demos are ideally done in-person; consider having separate demos for in-person and remote.


## Why

A regular discussion is critical to maintaining alignment between the team, the sponsor and key stakeholders, and setting expectations for furure work.  The demo allows the team to demonstrate their progress to date and speak to what they expect to accomplish next.  Equally important is the review of KPIs and user research.  Both may effect the work the team will undertake and its priority.  All parties must have the opportunity to understand the new information and agree on its meaning and impact to the product and business strategy.
