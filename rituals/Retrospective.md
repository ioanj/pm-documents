# Retrospective

## What

A weekly opportunity for a team to reflect on the past week of work and openly discuss the things that went well and things that can be improved upon.

## How

- Team members generate items and place them into Happy, Meh, and Sad columns 
- The Facilitator reads off each item and the room discusses it
- The facilitator collects action items as required 
- The last retroâ€™s action items are reviewed and current action items are assigned to individuals.

## Why

- Teams continually improve by regularly taking time to self-reflect and openly discuss victories and challenges
- Gives every team member a chance to have their voice heard
- Creates an opportunity to voice concerns in a safe space
- Results in action items that should be addressed before the next retro
