# Team Stand Up


## What

Each team meets to get a concise briefing from each member on what they accomplished the previous day, what they expect to accomplish today and if there is anything impeding their progress ("blockers")

## How

- Starts at the same time each day (typically immediately after the lab stand up)
- In turn, each team member _briefly_ shares
  - what they accomplished the previous day
  - What they expect to accompish today
  - If there are any impediments
- Any follow up questions or discussion is taken off-line
- Any pairing changes are discussed and agreed upon


## Why

- Provides a daily touch base for all team members
- Ensures each team member is aware of the others' work
- Allows proactive action on any blockers or a team member who may be challenged
- Supports team identity
